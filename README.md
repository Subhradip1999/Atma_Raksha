# Atma_Raksha
A FullStack Web development project to help fight domestic violence. 
The project is built as a part of the Vishwakarma Award, 2020, offered by AICTE and Govt of India.
The main objective of the project was to build a Web app(later, a mobile app) to help and seek help for the victims of domestic violence.
Working Principle: Whenever a user logs in, he/she will see who is also using the same app in his/her locality. If the user faces some serious problem, he/she will send a SOS message to the nearby users.
In this way without wasting time for the police/ambulance to reach, neighbours can spread their hands to each others in case of any kind of serious issues.
